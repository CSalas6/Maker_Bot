# Maker_Bot

Brief: A program(or more) that are designed with the expressed purpose of taking written text documents and creating the appropriate code files to complete the requested task. 

Extended: The program is intended to read through a multitude of code files, the target will be cpp code for the prototype, to develop a set of learned processes. Learning method will be through a char-by-char desgined markov chain and/or (planned) simple nerual network for bigger concepts. Data files will be saved in a csv file format using ASCII to represent the characters for the markov chain method. The input files should remain unchanged. Output files should include all primary, header, and makefiles nessissary. Comments embedded in the files will be limited, at most will be the word(s) that the program used from the Input to make the lines below said comment. 

Most files will be named as desired for memory purposes, and not indicitive of the contents within.
