-Flur and Lee are the parents of Markov and Warkov.
-Flur reads code files char by char and sends them to Markov.
-Lee reads the same code file as Flur, reads it word by word(separated by
whitespace), and then sends it to Warkov. 
-Markov is a data routine that uses the markov chain idea to procedurally
generate a new word, letter by letter, based on its database.
-Warkov is another data routine that uses the markov chain idea to
procedurally generate a new sentence, word by word, based on its database.
Warkov will use Markov to create new words as needed, like variables.
-Sakura and Joesph are the parents of Jane.
-Sakura will read the instruction files, namely txt, then sends it to Joesph.
-Joesph processes the data from Sakura to boil down the basics.
-Jane is married to Warkov, and has their child Oscar and pet cat Anna.
-Jane gets data from Joesph, who then with Warkov, creates the new code files
based on the simple instructions stated.
-Oscar is the "Main" file that will work as the interface to the user and will
confirm when the task is down. (Planned) Oscar will compile the code to ensure
it works, on failed compilation it will regenerate the broken file(s) (or maybe,
if good enough it will then read through the file to do any minor fixes).
-Anna is tasked with actual writing of the files and also saving the databases
of both Markov and Warkov.
